# ComcastCodeAssignment

I chose MVP to keep the code maintainable and scalable, further to ease unit testing

I chose Java over Kotlin as I was comfortable in Java and thought my interviewer too will like it, I am fair in Kotlin too

I used retrofit for its performance over volley, and retrofit suits best for REST API's

I couldn't add some animations because of time constraint, else I would have educated my user through animations about the flow of the app.

I have placeholders for unit testing and UI testing using espresso
